Password Strength Checker

Overview: The Password Strength Checker is a Python-based tool designed to evaluate the strength of user-provided passwords. It analyzes various aspects of the password, such as length, character variety, and diversity, providing actionable feedback to improve password security. This tool is useful for individuals or developers looking to ensure secure password practices.

Features ;
1. Length Validation:

Strong passwords must be at least 12 characters long.

Passwords 8-11 characters long receive a moderate score but are encouraged to be longer.

Passwords shorter than 8 characters are marked as weak.

2. Character Requirements:

Checks for uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

Provides suggestions to include missing character types.

3. Character Diversity:

Ensures at least 70% of the password characters are unique.

Flags passwords with low diversity for improvement.

4. Clear Feedback:

Returns detailed suggestions to improve weak or moderate passwords.

Provides positive reinforcement for strong passwords.
